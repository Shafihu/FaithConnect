## 4. Development & Challenges

### Development Methodology
FaithConnect was developed using an Agile approach with iterative development cycles. We prioritized core features first (authentication, service information, sermons) before adding more complex functionality (quizzes, community posts).

### Challenges Faced
- **Responsive Design**: Creating a consistent experience across all device sizes required careful planning of component layouts and media queries.
- **State Management**: As the application grew, managing state across components became more complex, requiring the implementation of Context API.
- **Community Posts System**: Balancing anonymity with accountability in the community posting system required thoughtful design decisions.
- **Data Organization**: Creating intuitive filtering and search systems for sermons and events required careful data structure planning.

### Testing & Debugging
- Component testing for UI elements
- User flow testing for authentication and key features
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness verification
